mainText|El Nino is a climate phenomenon that disrupts normal weather patterns and affects both human societies and wildlife. Scientists study it to understand its cycles and predict its impacts. Seabirds are important indicators of marine ecosystems because they depend on ocean resources for food. Changes in sea temperature and ice affect their survival. Marine mammals such as seals and sea lions have also shown signs of stress. Researchers believe long-term data is essential to understand these patterns fully.
